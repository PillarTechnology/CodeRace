# Code Race

[TODO: Add some more description]

See _notes.txt_ for some information about files/paths that racers need to know and work in.

## Running the server

```sh
npm install
npm start
```

Then, browse to [http://localhost:8081/signup]() to set up the usernames, emails, etc.

Note: All the client Kata code has now been moved to https://github.com/PillarTechnology/CodeRaceClients
